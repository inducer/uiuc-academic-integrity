    [TODO] Additional availability needed for Appeal Hearing

body: |

    Dear {{ First_name }},

    When attempting to schedule an appeal hearing with your involvement,
    I encountered a situation where no possible times work due to incompatible
    availability.

    I am writing to request that you revise your response to the availability
    poll, providing additional times if at all possible. I have reopened the poll
    for you, you can find it at:

    {{ Availability_URL }}

    Please provide your response by {{ updated_Response_deadline | format_timestamp("%B %d %I:%M %p") }}.

    Thank you!
    Andreas
    Chair, CS Academic Appeals Committee
