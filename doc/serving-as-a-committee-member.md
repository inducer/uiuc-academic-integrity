# How to be an academic appeals committee member

## (Work in progress)

## Change log

* Mar 20, 2024: Add note about interactions with third parties.

## Your role as a committee member

* View yourself like a member of a jury. You vote on the outcome of a case you hear. You are responsible for gathering enough information in order to be able to do so.  
* Refuse the temptation to “take sides early”. Always entertain the possibility that either side may have a valid case. Help them make it, by asking helpful, informative questions.  
* After the hearing concludes, help the chair write a report on what happened.

## Things to read and know

* [§1‑405 of the student code](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-405/)

The rest of this document assumes you have read this.

## Before the hearing

* Make sure to read all the case documentation in FAIR. A link should be included in the scheduling email.  
  * Make sure you know what is being appealed: finding and sanction, or sanction only.  
* If faculty: Verify that you are listed as an alternate host on the Zoom meeting. Email Andreas if not.  
* Verify that you are listed as part of the committee in FAIR. Email Andreas if not.  
* Ensure that you do not have a conflict of interest. Examples of this include  
  * Students that know the appellant beyond a passing familiarity should be viewed as having a conflict of interest.  
  * Faculty who have in the past alleged infractions of academic integrity on the part of the appellant, whether successfully or not,  should be viewed as having a conflict of interest.

  If you feel that you have a conflict of interest, email Andreas to be replaced.

## Participating in a hearing

* Join the Zoom meeting a few minutes early. Enable video.  
* Participate in the **open part of the hearing**:  
  * The committee members will take turns asking questions of the student and the instructor.  
  * Once you have no further questions, signal as much to the chair.  
  * Make sure to keep the discussion on track. Gently and politely make sure that the discussion is efficient and to the point.  
    * If at any point you feel that the student is being lectured by the instructor or a committee member, gently interrupt and steer the discussion in a more productive direction.  
* Participate in the discussion during the **closed part of the hearing**. The committee must vote on the following aspects:  
  * whether the appellant had grounds for appeal (**exclusively** one of four possible grounds, see §1‑405c)  
  * whether to uphold or change the finding (if the finding is being appealed)  
    * If changed, state the new finding.  
  * whether to uphold or change the sanction (if the sanction is being appealed)  
    * If changed (i.e. reduced), state the new sanction.  
  * Alternatively, a committee may vote to return the case to an earlier procedural step at which an error occurred.  
    * For example, if it emerges that an instructor has not done a proper investigation, a committee may tell them to do that by returning the case to the finding stage, rather than attempting to carry out an investigation themselves on the spot.  
    * Note that this includes the possibility of a renewed appeal, if deemed necessary by the appellant.

  Focus on what you need in order to vote on these aspects. Avoid discussions that do not help arrive at a vote.

## Interactions with third parties

It may happen that you are contacted by third parties (e.g. parents, consultants, friends of an appellant) regarding specifics of a FAIR case or hearing.  Should this happen, it is **critically important** that you  
do not engage.  Do not disclose any information, do not discuss the content of hearings, even if that person was present at the hearing. Instead, please politely refer these folks to Andreas, Elsa, or the academic office.
