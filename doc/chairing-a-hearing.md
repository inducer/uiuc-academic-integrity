## Your role as chair

* You should be impartial. You do not vote.
* Your main job is to ensure that a civil, rule-conforming hearing takes place.
  * You should help both parties effectively make their case.
* After the hearing concludes, you write a report on what happened. To enable you to write the report, you must make sure that the committee answers the questions before it during the hearing. See below for what these are, and note in particular that all votes need to be justified. (not just “voted to exonerate” but “voted to exonerate *because …*”)

## Things to read and know

* [§1‑405 of the student code](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-405/)

The rest of this document assumes you have read this.

## Before the hearing

* Make sure to read all the case documentation in FAIR. A link should be included in the scheduling email.
  * Make sure you know what is being appealed: finding and sanction, or sanction only.
* Verify that you are listed as an alternate host on the Zoom meeting. Email Andreas if not.
* Verify that you are listed as chair in FAIR. Email Andreas if not.
* Check for opening statements. These should be in the “Case Documentation” tab in FAIR.
  * Both the instructor and the student may provide them.
  * They could also be in your email. If they are there, make sure they get uploaded to FAIR.
* Make sure that the class syllabus and the exam/MP instructions are available in the case documentation in FAIR. If they are not, email the instructor to request them.
* Make a note of who your backup committee members are. Be prepared to contact them on short notice if your hearing committee winds up incomplete. Emails and phone numbers (if available) of your committee are in the chair preparation email you received.

## Running a hearing

* Join the Zoom meeting a few minutes early. Enable video (see below).
  * All hearing Zooms should be configured to have a waiting room. It is your job to admit participants. Only admit those who have a reason to be there.
* You may wish to record the hearing and/or produce an automated transcript. Make sure that only you have access.
* Verify that a full committee is present. (two voting faculty, one voting student member) Never start a hearing with an incomplete committee.
  * If the committee is incomplete, quickly contact backup members and wait for them to join.
* Instructor and student *may* be present, but they are not required to be. Wait a few minutes if they are not present, then proceed.
* Introduce yourself. State your role. Ask everyone present to briefly introduce themselves and state their role.
* Offer to turn on automatic closed captioning. Students with disabilities have a right to ask for this. Non-native speakers may benefit from it.
* Request that all participants turn on video, to ensure the confidentiality of the hearing. Be somewhat insistent here, but continue even if the request is not successful.
* Make a note of everyone who is present, to facilitate report writing later.
* Call the hearing to order.
  State the purpose of the hearing, including the case number.
  * Put the link to the FAIR case in the Zoom chat for everyone to refer to.
  * Briefly explain the order of the proceedings.
  * Explain what conflict of interest is. Request that hearing participants tell you (possibly privately via Zoom chat) if there are any perceived or actual conflicts of interest. Examples of this include
    * Students that know the appellant beyond a passing familiarity should be viewed as having a conflict of interest.
    * Faculty who have in the past alleged infractions of academic integrity on the part of the appellant, whether successfully or not,  should be viewed as having a conflict of interest.

    If a conflict of interest is detected at this stage, attempt to replace the conflicted member of the committee with a backup member. If this is not possible, the hearing should be aborted at this point and rescheduled for a later date.

* If a consultant is present, remind the hearing participants that they may observe and (quietly) interact with the appellant, but they may not otherwise participate.
* Thank and dismiss unneeded backup members who may have joined the hearing.
* Allow brief **opening statements**:
  * Allow an opening statement from the instructor, if applicable. If present, they will present it, otherwise you will read it. (“prosecution goes first”)
  * Allow an opening statement from the student, if applicable. If present, they will present it, otherwise you will read it.
* Facilitate the discussion during the **open part of the hearing**:
  * The committee members will take turns asking questions of the student and the instructor.
  * Instructor and student may ask questions of each other, through you.
  * You may reject a question if it has already been answered, is irrelevant, or is inappropriate. You may reword questions before they are answered if they are confusing or intended to disparage, intimidate, or otherwise harass the individual being questioned.
  * Once the committee has no further questions, state that the open part of the meeting is ending.
  * Make sure to keep the discussion on track. Gently and politely make sure that the discussion is efficient and to the point.
    * If at any point you feel that the student is being lectured by the instructor or a committee member, gently interrupt and steer the discussion in a more productive direction.
* Dismiss the instructor and the student.
* Facilitate the discussion during the **closed part of the hearing**. The committee must vote on the following aspects:
  * whether the appellant had grounds for appeal (**exclusively** one of four possible grounds, see §1‑405c)
  * whether to uphold or change the finding (if the finding is being appealed)
    * If changed, state the new finding.
  * whether to uphold or change the sanction (if the sanction is being appealed)
    * If changed (i.e. reduced), state the new sanction.
  * Alternatively, a committee may vote to return the case to an earlier procedural step at which an error occurred.
    * For example, if it emerges that an instructor has not done a proper investigation, a committee may tell them to do that by returning the case to the finding stage, rather than attempting to carry out an investigation themselves on the spot.
    * Note that this includes the possibility of a renewed appeal, if deemed necessary by the appellant.

  Focus the committee’s attention on what they need in order to vote on these aspects. Gently steer them away from discussions that do not help arrive at a vote.

## Possible outcomes of a hearing

Ideally, a hearing should end with a vote on the points described above. If this is not possible, at your discretion, a hearing may be rescheduled for a later time. You may also decide that a break is in order, however note that hearings are scheduled for 90 minutes, and participants may become unavailable beyond this time, so this is challenging in practice.

## The report

Must include the following information:

* A brief summary of the allegation,
* the committee’s response to the questions above (including a rationale),
* who attended the hearing,
* what information was being gathered and considered, and
* whether the votes were unanimous.
* If the committee voted that the appellant had grounds for appeal, state which of the four grounds the committee considered applicable.
* It must justify, based on the information considered, the decision made by the committee.

It should be between about a half page and a full page in length, depending on the complexity of the case. It is good practice to get it approved by the committee before sending it on.

Unless you have strong reasons to do otherwise, please use Box’s “notes” feature for authoring and sharing committee reports. Not only does this allow collaborative editing with your committee members, it is also FERPA compliant, unlike sending reports via email.

Once the report is finished and approved, please share it with Andreas (via the built-in “Share” feature) *and* send a separate email to him mentioning that the report is complete and ready for processing. If there are issues with the report, Andreas will provide feedback typically via notes on the report directly in Box, allowing you to address them. Once done, once again please send a quick email to indicate that the revisions have been completed and approved by the committee.

By the student code, the report is due **within three business days** of the appeal hearing.

## Interactions with third parties

It may happen that you are contacted by third parties (e.g. parents, consultants, friends of an appellant) regarding specifics of a FAIR case or hearing.  Should this happen, it is **critically important** that you do not engage.  Do not disclose any information, do not discuss the content of hearings, even if that person was present at the hearing. Instead, please politely refer these folks to Andreas, Elsa, or the academic office.
