body: |

    All,

    Thank you very much for agreeing to participate in the CS academic appeal
    hearing for FAIR case {{ CaseID }}. The hearing will take place at

    at this Zoom meeting link:

    {{ Hearing_Location }}

    All faculty committee members are alternative hosts for this meeting.

    Before the hearing, please take a moment to review the details of the
    case, via the FAIR system:

    {{ URL }}

    You should all have access; if you do not, please let me know.

    You may see your role in the hearing from the following list:

    {{ Role_list }}

    If you are listed as a backup member, please keep a close eye on your
    email around the hearing time (+15 minutes) and join the hearing if
    asked to do so by the chair. A (non-voting) chair, two (voting) faculty
    committee members, and a (voting) student member are required to be in
    attendance in order for the hearing to proceed.

    The procedure for the hearing is outlined in the student code, in §1‑405f:

    https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-405/

    Please take a brief look beforehand so you know what to expect. The
    chair will guide the participants through the meeting following this
    procedure.

    The appellant and the instructor *may* attend the meeting, but this is
    not required. They are each allowed a brief opening statement at the
    beginning of the hearing. If not attending, they may submit the opening
    statement to the chair by email, who will enter it as case documentation
    into the FAIR system and read the statement at the beginning of the
    hearing. The open part of the hearing is next, during which committee
    members may ask questions (through the chair) of the instructor and the
    appellant. After this, appellant and instructor are dismissed and the
    committee deliberates in closed session.

    The goal of the deliberation is to establish, via simple majority vote:

    - whether the appellant had grounds for appeal (one of four possible
      grounds, see §1‑405c)
    - whether to uphold or change the finding (if the finding is being appealed)
    - whether to uphold or change the sanction (if the sanction is being appealed)

    After the hearing completes, the chair provides a written report, about
    a paragraph in length, via email to me, within three business days of
    the hearing. The report must specify the committee's response to the
    three questions above (including a rationale), who attended the meeting,
    what information was being gathered and considered, whether the votes
    were unanimous, and it must justify, based on the information
    considered, the decision made by the committee.

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.

    Andreas
    Chair, CS Academic Appeals Committee
