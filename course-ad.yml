    [Course Ad, please disseminate] Fast Algorithms & Integral Equations

body: |

    Dear {{ First_name }},

    This spring I will be offering a course "Fast Algorithms and Integral
    Equation Methods" that I thought might be relevant to some members
    of your research group as well as computationally inclined graduate
    students in {{ Department }}.

    It would be fantastic if you could pass this course ad along to any
    students who you think might be interested.

    Tue/Thu 11:00-12:15, 1302 Siebel

    Split roughly in two parts, the course explores numerical methods and
    algorithms for the solution of boundary value problems for elliptic PDEs
    having optimal or near-optimal complexity.  Beginning from low-rank
    properties in numerical linear algebra, the course introduces classical
    fast algorithms such as Ewald summation, Barnes-Hut, Fast Multipole and the
    butterfly method, as well as direct solvers for matrices of singular-kernel
    type, highlighting the intimate relationship between smoothness of
    functions and numerical rank. This set of tools is then brought to bear in
    the computational context of integral equations, which are introduced
    rigorously, including the necessary foundations in functional analysis. In
    discussing high-order unstructured discretizations in 2D and 3D and
    associated quadrature methods, the course closes by giving an overview of
    practical, large-scale methods for the numerical solution of elliptic PDE
    boundary value problems.

    A practical note: I will be on travel on Thu Jan 18, so the second class
    period of the semester will be canceled.

    Thanks!
    Andreas
