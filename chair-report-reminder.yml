    [OVERDUE] Committee report for FAIR{{ CaseID }}

body: |

    {{ First_name }},

    Thank you for chairing the appeal hearing for FAIR {{ CaseID }}.
    The hearing took place {{ Hearing_start | format_timestamp("%B %d %I:%M %p") }}.

    The details of the case may be found at
    {{ URL }}

    By the student code, the consensus committee report is due
    within three days of the appeal hearing.

    Please work with your commitee right away to complete the report and share
    it with me for review. The report should address the following questions:

    - whether the appellant had grounds for appeal (exclusively one of four possible grounds, see §1‑405c)
    - whether to uphold or change the finding (if the finding is being appealed)
        - If changed, state the new finding.
    - whether to uphold or change the sanction (if the sanction is being appealed)
        - If changed (i.e. reduced), state the new sanction.

    In addition, it should state:

    - who attended the hearing,
    - what information was being gathered and considered,
    - whether the votes were unanimous, and
    - it must justify, based on the information considered, the decision made by the committ

    Thank you!
