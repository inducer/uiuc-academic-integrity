    [TODO] Request for phone number

body: |

    Dear {{ First_name }},

    You are listed as someone who might serve on an academic appeals committee. To
    allow communications in case of outages or in urgent cases, please respond to
    this email with a phone number that can be used to reach you quickly during
    business hours. This phone number will only be shared with chairs of hearing
    committees (i.e. CS faculty) and used only by them in connection with
    academic appeals hearings.

    If you prefer not to provide this information, please also respond saying so.

    Thank you!
    Andreas
