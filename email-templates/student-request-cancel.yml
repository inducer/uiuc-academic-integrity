    [CANCELING] No student committee members for FAIR {{ CaseID }} hearing

body: |

    Hi Heather,

    I will no longer need student committee members for FAIR{{ CaseID }}
    for now, as the hearing will need to be rescheduled. I will be in touch
    again later once I have found a new set of faculty.

    The appellants for this hearing are: {{ Appellants }}

    {% if Notes -%}
    Some notes about this appeal:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    {{ Notes }}
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    {% endif -%}

    The hearing was previously scheduled for {{ Hearing_start | format_timestamp("%B %d %I:%M %p") }}.

    Andreas
