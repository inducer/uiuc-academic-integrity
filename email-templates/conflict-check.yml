    Conflict Check for FAIR{{ CaseID }}

body: |

    Steve,

    I am assembling a committee to hear an appeal for FAIR{{ CaseID }} to be
    heard at {{ Hearing_start | format_timestamp("%B %d %I:%M %p") }}.

    Could you please take a look at the rosters of classes taught by these faculty:

    {{ Faculty_list }}

    and let me know if they are currently teaching a class taken by these
    appellant(s):

    {{ Appellants }}

    A response by email saying 'no conflict' or specifying the nature of the
    conflict suffices.

    Thanks!

    Andreas
    Chair, CS Academic Appeals
